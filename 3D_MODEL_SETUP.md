# 3D Model Setup Guide

## Current Status
✅ **System Ready**: The avatar system is now configured to attempt loading the 3D model first
⚠️ **Model Missing**: The actual 3D model file needs to be downloaded and installed

## What You'll See Now
Since the 3D model file doesn't exist yet, the system will:
1. Attempt to load the 3D model from `/models/cartoon-puppy.glb`
2. Fail gracefully and automatically fall back to the geometric avatar
3. Show console logs about the loading attempts

## How to Get the Actual 3D Model

### Step 1: Download from Sketchfab
1. Go to the model page: https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/3d-cartoon-puppy-395efb909b1844dbbcd2f3fa3b60ed9b
2. Create a free Sketchfab account (if you don't have one)
3. Click the "Download" button
4. Select "GLB" format (recommended for web use)
5. Download the file

### Step 2: Install the Model
1. Extract the downloaded ZIP file
2. Find the `.glb` file (usually the largest file)
3. Rename it to `cartoon-puppy.glb`
4. Copy it to: `apps/frontend/public/models/cartoon-puppy.glb`

### Step 3: Verify Installation
The correct file structure should be:
```
apps/frontend/public/models/cartoon-puppy.glb
```

### Step 4: Test the Model
1. Refresh your browser
2. Check the browser console for loading messages
3. You should see the 3D model instead of the geometric avatar

## Expected Behavior

### With 3D Model File Present:
- ✅ Loads the actual 3D cartoon puppy model
- ✅ Shows realistic textures and details
- ✅ Supports animations (if available in the model)
- ✅ Responds to speaking/typing states with procedural animations

### Without 3D Model File (Current State):
- ✅ Gracefully falls back to geometric avatar
- ✅ Shows console warnings about missing model
- ✅ Full functionality with geometric shapes
- ✅ No errors or crashes

## Troubleshooting

### Model Not Loading
1. **Check File Path**: Ensure the file is at exactly `apps/frontend/public/models/cartoon-puppy.glb`
2. **Check File Format**: Must be `.glb` format (not `.gltf` with separate files)
3. **Check File Size**: Should be several MB (if it's tiny, download might have failed)
4. **Clear Browser Cache**: Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Console Errors
- Open browser Developer Tools (F12)
- Check Console tab for error messages
- Look for network errors or file loading failures

### Performance Issues
- The 3D model may be more resource-intensive than the geometric avatar
- Consider using geometric avatar for lower-end devices
- Model will automatically fall back if loading fails

## Development Notes
- The system is designed to be resilient - it will always show some avatar
- Error boundaries prevent crashes if the 3D model has issues
- Suspense provides loading states during model loading
- Procedural animations work with both 3D model and geometric avatar
