# How to Get the 3D Model Working

## Current Status
ðŸ”„ **System is now trying to load the 3D model** but will fall back to geometric avatar since the model file doesn't exist yet.

## Quick Steps to Get the 3D Model

### 1. Download the Model
- Go to: https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/3d-cartoon-puppy-395efb909b1844dbbcd2f3fa3b60ed9b
- Sign up for free Sketchfab account
- Click "Download" â†’ Select "GLB" format
- Download the file

### 2. Install the Model
- Extract the downloaded ZIP
- Find the `.glb` file (usually largest file)
- Rename it to `cartoon-puppy.glb`
- Put it in: `apps/frontend/public/models/cartoon-puppy.glb`

### 3. Refresh Your Browser
- The system will automatically detect the model and use it
- If it fails, it will fall back to the geometric avatar

## What You Should See Right Now

**In your browser console** (F12 â†’ Console), you should see messages like:
- "Attempting to load 3D model from: /models/cartoon-puppy.glb"
- "Failed to load GLTF model: [error message]"
- "3D model not available, will use fallback"
- "Using geometric fallback due to error"

**In your application**, you should see:
- The geometric puppy avatar (made of shapes)
- It will try to load the 3D model first, then fall back

## Once You Install the Model

You'll see:
- A realistic 3D cartoon puppy instead of geometric shapes
- Better textures and details
- Smoother animations
- Console messages showing successful loading

## Need Help?
- Check the browser console for error messages
- Make sure the file path is exactly: `apps/frontend/public/models/cartoon-puppy.glb`
- The system is designed to always show some avatar, so it won't break
