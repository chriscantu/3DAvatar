# Avatar Setup Guide

## Current Status

✅ **Geometric Avatar**: Working and displayed by default
⚠️ **3D Model Avatar**: Available but requires model file setup

## What You Should See Now

You should now see a **geometric 3D puppy avatar** in your application. This avatar:
- Is made of geometric shapes (spheres, cylinders, etc.)
- Has proper animations and interactions
- Responds to speaking and typing states
- Is positioned correctly in the room

## How to Enable the 3D Model Avatar

If you want to use the actual 3D model from Sketchfab instead of the geometric avatar:

### Step 1: Download the Model
1. Go to [Sketchfab Model Page](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/3d-cartoon-puppy-395efb909b1844dbbcd2f3fa3b60ed9b)
2. Create a free Sketchfab account if needed
3. Click "Download" and select GLB format
4. Extract the downloaded file

### Step 2: Install the Model
1. Create directory: `apps/frontend/public/models/`
2. Copy the GLB file to: `apps/frontend/public/models/cartoon-puppy.glb`

### Step 3: Enable 3D Model
In `apps/frontend/src/components/Avatar.tsx`, change line 17:
```typescript
// Change this:
const [use3DModel, setUse3DModel] = useState(false);

// To this:
const [use3DModel, setUse3DModel] = useState(true);
```

### Step 4: Test
The system will automatically:
- Try to load the 3D model first
- Fall back to geometric avatar if model fails
- Show loading states during model loading

## Avatar Features

Both avatars support:
- **Speaking Animation**: Responds when avatar is speaking
- **Typing Response**: Reacts when user is typing
- **Movement Intensity**: Subtle, animated, or energetic movements
- **Message Length**: Animation intensity based on message length
- **Positioning**: Proper placement in the 3D room

## Troubleshooting

### Avatar Not Visible
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify Three.js dependencies are installed
- Ensure Canvas component is properly rendered

### 3D Model Not Loading
- Verify model file exists at correct path
- Check file format is GLB
- System will automatically fall back to geometric avatar

### Performance Issues
- 3D model may be more resource-intensive
- Geometric avatar is optimized for performance
- Consider using geometric avatar for lower-end devices

## Development Notes

The avatar system uses:
- **React Three Fiber** for 3D rendering
- **@react-three/drei** for utilities
- **Error boundaries** for graceful fallbacks
- **Suspense** for loading states
- **TypeScript** for type safety

Current implementation provides robust fallback mechanisms ensuring users always see a working avatar regardless of model availability.
