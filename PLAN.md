# 3DAvatar Project Plan

## Overview
Build a 3D room in React using Three.js, featuring a cartoon dog avatar that users can chat with via text or voice. The avatar is powered by the OpenAI API, with a secure backend proxy. The project includes comprehensive unit and end-to-end tests, and is deployable on Vercel.
